# Maximum Common Induced Subgraph

This is my first work concerning Graph Theory.
This is a Python 3 implementation of a solution to find the Maximum Common Induced Subgraph (MCIS) between two undirected NetworkX graphs. **It concerns only topology**, I have not focus my work in terms of isomorphism.

# Installation

Clone this repository and make sure that you have all the required dependencies in the requirements.txt (you can use pip install with it). The notebook's objective is only to make a short demo of my algorithm. The files mcs.py and utils.py work together.
